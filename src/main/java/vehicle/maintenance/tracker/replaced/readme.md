**Replaced (old implementation)**

Within this package are old classes that dealt with IO for the database.
All classes worked together to perform the task of saving, updating, deleting entities in the 
database. Since the application has been switch over to use the hibernate. These classes are now
redundant. 

_I have kept them to show the differences between what I did before hibernate and
what I am doing now._
